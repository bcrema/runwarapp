# Agent Instructions

- Always guarantee test coverage and passing test results for changes.
- This is a monorepo. When working in the backend, frontend, or iOS directories, read and follow any AGENTS.md files within those respective directory trees.
- Always create and work on a dedicated feature branch (never commit directly to the main branch) so reviews happen via focused pull requests and unwanted merges are avoided.
